<h1>Under Construction</h1>	

<p>If you've found your way here, it's probably because I sent you a link to my github page. Nothing much to see here yet. </p>

<p>I'm working on getting my projects uploaded and refactored. These will include the following, most of which I made during my coding bootcamp in 1Q 2016. </p>

<ul>
<li>Hackathon First Place Winner (Dec 2015) - Cronopio, an alternative lending platform for eSports </li>
<li> Hackathon First Place Winner (Feb 2016) - AzizBot, an AI-run conversational tone analyzer using IBM's Watson API </li>
<li>Final Project: BotServer, a chatbot deployment platform using Node.js and a further refinement of AzizBotbr	</li>
<li>StarTrek CSS/Javascript: studies in javascript and page manipulationbr	</li>
<li>TicTacToe Javascript exercise </li>
<li>Others to follow including RESTful API, AJAX/JSON, ORM, MVC Banking project, etc. </li>
	</ul>

<p>I'll be updating my public repo site regularly. </p>

<p>thanks and regards,</p>
