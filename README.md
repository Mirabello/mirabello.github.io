#Under Construction

If you've found your way here, it's probably because I sent you a link to my github page. Nothing much to see here yet. 

I'm working on getting my projects uploaded and refactored. These will include the following, most of which I made during my coding bootcamp in 1Q 2016.  

1. Hackathon First Place Winner (Dec 2015) - Cronopio, an alternative lending platform for eSports
2. Hackathon First Place Winner (Feb 2016) - AzizBot, an AI-run conversational tone analyzer using IBM's Watson API
3. Final Project:  [BotServer](https://github.com/Mirabello/Closers2015-BotServer), a chatbot deployment platform using Node.js and a further refinement of AzizBot
4. StarTrek CSS/Javascript:  studies in javascript and page manipulation
5. TicTacToe
7. Others to follow including RESTful API,  AJAX/JSON, ORM, MVC Banking project, etc.

I'll be updating my public repo site regularly.

thanks and regards,
